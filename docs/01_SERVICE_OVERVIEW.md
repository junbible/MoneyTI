# Service Overview: MoneyTI

## 1. Introduction
**MoneyTI** is a fintech service that combines the popular MBTI personality framework with investment strategies. It aims to lower the psychological barrier to entry for new investors by recommending Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that align with their inherent personality traits.

## 2. Core Concept
> "Invest like you really are."

Many people fail at investing because they adopt strategies that don't fit their temperament. MoneyTI helps users discover an investment style that feels natural and sustainable for them.

## 3. How It Works
The service maps MBTI dimensions to investment preferences:

- **E (Extraversion) vs I (Introversion)**:
    - *E*: May prefer dynamic, market-leading sectors or active ETFs.
    - *I*: May prefer steady, long-term compouding or broad market indices.
- **S (Sensing) vs N (Intuition)**:
    - *S*: Focus on tangible assets, real estate (REITs), or dividend aristocrats.
    - *N*: Focus on future growth, innovative tech, or thematic ETFs.
- **T (Thinking) vs F (Feeling)**:
    - *T*: Performance-driven, quantitative, metric-focused funds.
    - *F*: ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) or value-aligned funds.
- **J (Judging) vs P (Perceiving)**:
    - *J*: Structured, balanced rebalancing, fixed-income weighted.
    - *P*: Flexible, opportunistic, higher volatility tolerance.

## 4. Target Audience
- **MZ Generation**: Familiar with MBTI and looking for easy investment starts.
- **Investment Beginners**: Overwhelmed by too many choices in the stock market.
- **Novelty Seekers**: Looking for a fun way to explore financial products.

## 5. Unique Selling Point (USP)
- **Simplicity**: No complex financial jargon; just personality types.
- **Personalization**: Recommendations feel tailored and "sticky".
- **Actionable**: Direct link to specific ETF tickers, not just vague advice.
